Welcome to module two.
This will be on the theory of the derivative.
In module three, we'll go into applications of it as a tool for problem
solving.
But in this module, we're gonna focus on the hard core mathematics.
We'll begin with a discussion of tangent lines, which will geometrically
motivate some of what follows.
We'll then go to a formal definition of the derivative, which will be, again,
very mathematical and in terms of a limit.
We'll then discuss rates of change.
2.4 will be a very large sub­module.
It will be a discussion of different rules you can use to compute
derivatives.
We don't want to be using the definition every time we have to compute a
derivative.
It becomes too slow, so we'll discuss ways to deal with certain types of
functions in this sub­module.
We'll then chat briefly about higher order derivatives, that is, derivatives
beyond a first derivative.
These also have meaning and are computed in the same way.
In 2.6, we'll discuss a topic that's a little bit tricky called implicit
differentiation.
This gives us a way for computing derivatives when I don't explicitly have
a function in the form y equals f of x.
So, when things are mixed up, how do you take derivatives? 2.7 is
L'Hopital's Rule.
This is a nice trick to compute certain types of limits.
In 2.8, we'll say essentially as little as we need to say about the basic
theoretical results, regarding when functions are differentiable versus
continuous.
This is a little bit important for the CLEP exam, but we'll only discuss the
essentials.
And then, we'll conclude in 2.9 with a discussion of how to take the
derivative of an inverse function.
There's a nice theorem that says I don't necessarily need to be able to
compute the inverse function exactly.
I can use special tools and a cute algebraic argument to show you exactly
what the derivative of an inverse function needs to be, given the original
function.

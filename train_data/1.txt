Welcome to the Modern States course in calculus.
Our goal is to prepare you for the CLEP exam in calculus.
We'll start with the fundamental notion of the limit.
From this, we'll develop techniques for derivatives and integrals, but this
is really our foundation.
So we'll begin with the formal definition of the limit.
So this is going to be a bit technical, and is sometimes called the epsilon­
delta definition of the limit.
We basically just have to do it to get it out of the way.
It's classical, it's standard, but it won't be so important for us.
We'll then do the more practical work of how to actually compute some
basic limits to understand how they're different than just evaluating the
function.
We'll then introduce the notion of continuity, which is essential for
calculus.
If you think of calculus as a method for studying functions, continuity is a
minimal assumption to make on functions to do calculus.
That is, if I don't have a continuous function, it's hard to do anything with
the tools we develop in this course.
And the last we'll develop is something called the squeeze theorem,
which is very specialized tool for handling certain types of limits.
So this is, I think, some very beautiful mathematics, the squeeze theorem,
there's certainly something you would cover in more detail in a proof­
based calculus course, something you would take maybe in your third
year of college.
But for us, it's just a tool, and we'll only spend a little bit of time on it.
So the essentials will be the first three, and 1.4 would be something a
little bit special.

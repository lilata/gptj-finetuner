So far, in our study of derivatives, everything has been somewhat difficult,
I would say.
We introduced the definition of a derivative and before and after that, we
had related it to two geometric concept, by one geometric concept, the
idea of the secant line, the tangent line, and another more general
concept that of average and instantaneous rates of change.
But in all of these cases, when we actually had to do something with the
derivative, we had to take a limit and that could get tricky.
The most complicated thing we looked at was taking the derivative of f of
x equals x squared which is really not so complicated in the grand
scheme of things but even that was a little bit difficult for us.
What we're going to do in subÂ­module 2.4 is present a variety of
techniques to compute derivatives quickly.
We'll show some basic rules to start with, then we'll go to probably the
most important derivative rule which is the chain rule, which discusses
how to compute derivatives of compositions of functions.
We'll then look at exponential and logarithmic functions, trigonometric
functions, and inverse trigonometric functions.
Those three sections, exponentials logs, trig, inverse trig requires some
memorization.
We'll introduce the basic rules for these and look at some examples, but
only through a lots and lots and lots of practice can you really hope to
commit these rules to memory so that when you take the CLEP exam and
they ask you something like, "What's the derivative of arctangent of X
plus one?", it comes in 15 seconds.
Only through practice can you get to that level.
